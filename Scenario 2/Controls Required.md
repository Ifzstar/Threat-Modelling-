**Controls Required:**
-   AI-Powered Review Moderation: Implement advanced AI/ML algorithms to detect and flag patterns of fake or bot-generated reviews in real-time.
  
- CAPTCHA Challenges: Introduce CAPTCHA mechanisms for users submitting reviews to differentiate between bots and legitimate users.

- IP and Account Monitoring: Monitor for unusual activity such as multiple reviews from the same IP address or new accounts generating reviews at high volume.

- Review Submission Limits: Restrict the number of reviews a single account can submit in a short time frame to prevent mass fake review submissions.

- Verified Purchase Reviews: Only allow users who have purchased a product through the platform to submit reviews, verifying the authenticity of the feedback.

-  Sentiment Analysis: Use sentiment analysis tools to detect and flag overly positive or negative reviews, especially if they follow repetitive patterns.

-  User Behavioral Analysis: Track user behavior and patterns (e.g., time spent on product pages before leaving reviews) to detect bots or automated systems.

- Flagged Review Audits: Set up manual review teams or systems to audit flagged reviews for authenticity, ensuring that suspicious content gets additional scrutiny.

- Two-Step Review Authentication: Introduce multi-factor authentication for submitting reviews to prevent unauthorized or bot-driven submissions.

- Reputation Risk Alerts: Create alerts to notify the platformâ€™s security team when abnormal review activity is detected that could indicate an AI-generated attack on product ratings.
